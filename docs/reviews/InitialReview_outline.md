## Slide 3: Problem Statement

**The Challenge in Consumer Complaint Processing:**

- **High Volume:** Consumer-facing organizations receive massive volumes of textual complaints that cannot be manually processed.
- **Inconsistency:** Different support agents classify similar complaints differently, leading to poor service quality.
- **Lack of Explanation:** Traditional "Black Box" ML models provide labels (e.g., "Billing") without explaining *why*, reducing trust and transparency.
- **Architectural Gaps:** Many AI projects lack professional structure, making them unsuitable for real-world enterprise deployment.

## Slide 4: Proposed Solution

**A Hybrid AI Approach with Enterprise Architecture:**

- **Deterministic ML Classification:** Scikit-learn models (Logistic Regression/SVM) for fast, consistent, and accurate classification.
- **Generative AI Explanations:** Google Gemini generates human-readable explanations for model decisions (Explainable AI).
- **N-Tier Architecture:** Professional 5-layer architecture ensuring scalability, maintainability, and security.
- **Complete ML Lifecycle:** From text preprocessing and feature extraction to inference and explainability.
- **Database Persistence:** All complaints, predictions, and explanations stored for audit trails and analytics.

## Slide 5: How This Differs from Existing Solutions

**Key Differentiators:**

| Aspect | Existing Solutions | This Project |
|:-------|:------------------|:-------------|
| **Architecture** | Monolithic scripts or notebooks | N-Tier enterprise architecture (5 layers) |
| **Explainability** | Label prediction only | GenAI-powered natural language explanations |
| **ML Approach** | Complex transformers requiring GPUs | Lightweight Scikit-learn models (CPU-optimized) |
| **Transparency** | Black-box predictions | Full audit trail + confidence scoring |
| **Deployment** | Academic prototypes | Production-ready with database persistence |

**Unique Innovations:**

1. **Hybrid ML + GenAI Architecture:** Combines traditional ML (Logistic Regression/SVM) for fast, accurate classification with Google Gemini for human-readable explanations of model decisions.
2. **CPU-Optimized Inference:** Uses TF-IDF + Scikit-learn models requiring no expensive GPU infrastructure, enabling deployment on standard servers.
3. **Enterprise N-Tier Design:** Professional 5-layer architecture with clear separation of concerns—Presentation, Application, AI/ML Processing, Data Access, and Data layers.
4. **Explainable AI Integration:** Consumers and support teams receive actionable context: *"Classified as 'Billing Issue' due to mentions of unauthorized charges and payment disputes. Confidence: 92%."*
5. **Complete Audit Trail:** Every complaint, prediction, confidence score, and explanation persisted in PostgreSQL for compliance and analytics.
6. **Production-Ready Security:** Environment-based configuration, parameterized SQL queries preventing injection attacks, and comprehensive error handling.

## Slide 5: Key Features

- **Automated Complaint Triage:** Instantly categorizes complaints into predefined classes (Billing, Product, Service, Delivery).
- **Confidence Scoring:** Each classification includes a confidence score for reliability assessment.
- **Explainable AI (XAI):** Natural language explanations generated by Google Gemini for transparency.
- **NLP Pipeline:** Production-grade text cleaning, tokenization, and TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Persistent Audit Trail:** Complete logging in PostgreSQL for compliance and historical analysis.
- **Secure & Modular:** Environment-based configuration, SQL-injection safe, and easily maintainable.

## Slide 6: Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|:------|:-----------|
| **Backend/API** | Python 3.12, Flask 3.x |
| **Machine Learning** | Scikit-learn, TF-IDF Vectorizer, Logistic Regression/SVM |
| **Generative AI** | Google Gemini API (Prompt Engineering) |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL / MySQL |
| **Architecture** | N-Tier (5 Layers) |
| **DevOps** | Docker/Podman (Optional), GitHub Actions |

## Slide 7: System Architecture

**Five-Layer N-Tier Enterprise Architecture:**

1. **Presentation Layer:** REST API endpoints (JSON) for client applications.
2. **Application Layer:** Flask orchestrating routing, validation, and business logic.
3. **AI/ML Processing Layer:**
   - ML Module: Preprocessing → TF-IDF → Classification
   - GenAI Module: Explanation generation via Google Gemini
4. **Data Access Layer:** Parameterized SQL queries (psycopg2) for secure database operations.
5. **Data Layer:** PostgreSQL storing complaints, classifications, explanations, and audit logs.

---

## Slide 8: ML Pipeline & Workflow

**Complete Classification Workflow:**

1. **Input:** Consumer complaint text received via API.
2. **Preprocessing:** Text cleaning, lowercasing, stopword removal, tokenization.
3. **Feature Extraction:** TF-IDF vectorization converts text to numerical features.
4. **Classification:** Trained ML model (Logistic Regression/SVM) predicts complaint category.
5. **Confidence Scoring:** Model provides probability score for prediction reliability.
6. **GenAI Explanation:** Google Gemini generates human-readable justification.
7. **Storage:** Result, confidence score, and explanation persisted in database.

## Slide 9: Explainable AI Integration

**Making AI Transparent and Trustworthy:**

- **Why Explainability Matters:**
  - Builds trust with consumers and support teams.
  - Ensures compliance with AI transparency regulations.
  - Enables validation and debugging of model decisions.

- **How It Works:**
  - **Input to Gemini:** Original complaint text + ML prediction + confidence score.
  - **Output from Gemini:** "This complaint was classified as 'Billing Issue' because it mentions account charges, unauthorized fees, and payment disputes. Confidence: 92%."
  - **Prompt Engineering:** Optimized instructions ensure factual, concise explanations.

## Slide 10: Real-World Applications

**Industries Benefiting from This System:**

- **Banking & Finance:** Automated routing of credit card disputes, loan complaints, and account issues.
- **E-Commerce:** Categorizing product defects, delivery delays, and return requests for faster resolution.
- **Telecommunications:** Analyzing service quality complaints, network outages, and billing errors.
- **Public Sector:** Managing citizen grievances in government portals and municipal systems.
- **Healthcare:** Triaging patient feedback about appointments, billing, and service quality.
