## Project Synopsis: Consumer Complaints ML + GenAI System

### 🏷️ Project Title
**AI-Based Consumer Complaints Classification System using Machine Learning and Generative AI**

---

### 📝 Description
The **Consumer Complaints ML + GenAI System** is an enterprise-grade solution designed to automate the ingestion, classification, and explanation of textual consumer complaints. By leveraging a hybrid AI architecture, the system combines the deterministic accuracy of **Machine Learning (ML)** with the interpretative power of **Generative AI (GenAI)**.

The system is built on a robust **five-layer N-Tier architecture**, ensuring a clean separation between the presentation, business logic, AI/ML processing, data access, and persistent storage layers. This modular design facilitates easy maintenance, scalability, and adherence to professional software engineering standards.

### 🚀 Key Features
- **Automated Triage:** Instantly categorizes complaints into predefined buckets (Billing, Product, Service, etc.).
- **Confidence Scoring:** Provides a reliability metric for every classification decision.
- **Explainable AI (XAI):** Uses Google Gemini to translate numerical model outputs into human-readable explanations.
- **Persistent Audit Trail:** Stores every complaint, classification, and explanation in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Admin Analytics:** Provides insights into complaint trends and system performance.

---

### 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Python (Flask), SQLAlchemy ORM.
- **AI/ML:** Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression/SVM), TF-IDF Vectorization.
- **GenAI:** Google Gemini (Instruction-Based Prompting).
- **Database:** PostgreSQL.
- **DevOps:** GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Docker/Podman, PowerShell Automation.

---

### 🌍 Real-World Applications
- **Banking & Finance:** Automated routing of credit card and loan disputes.
- **E-Commerce:** Categorizing product defects and delivery issues for faster resolution.
- **Telecom:** Analyzing service quality complaints and network outage reports.
- **Public Sector:** Managing citizen grievances in municipal portals.

### 🏆 Expected Outcomes
1.  **Efficiency:** Reduces manual classification time by over 90%.
2.  **Consistency:** Eliminates human bias in complaint categorization.
3.  **Transparency:** Provides consumers with clear reasons for how their complaints are handled.
4.  **Traceability:** Enables historical auditing and longitudinal analysis of complaint data.
