## Abstract

Consumer-facing organizations receive large volumes of textual complaints through digital platforms such as web portals, emails, and customer support systems. Manual classification of these complaints is inefficient, inconsistent, and difficult to scale as data volume increases. This project presents an **AI-Based Consumer Complaints Classification System** that leverages **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to automatically categorize consumer complaints into predefined classes such as billing issues, service quality, delivery problems, and product defects.

A **Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)** module, powered by **Google Gemini**, is integrated as a post-classification layer to generate **human-readable explanations and summaries**. This hybrid approach ensures that while the core classification remains deterministic and traceable, the output is enhanced for transparency and interpretability, bridging the gap between numerical model decisions and human understanding.

The system is implemented using an **enterprise N-Tier architecture** comprising a presentation layer, application layer, AI/ML processing layer, data access layer, and a relational database. The architecture ensures modularity, scalability, and maintainability, making it suitable for both academic evaluation and real-world deployment. The project demonstrates a complete ML lifecycle—from text preprocessing and feature extraction to model inference and explainable AI generation—all within a secured, disciplined software engineering framework.
